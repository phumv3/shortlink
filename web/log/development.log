DEPRECATION WARNING: Enumerating ActiveModel::Errors as a hash has been deprecated.
In Rails 6.1, `errors` is an array of Error objects,
therefore it should be accessed by a block with a single block
parameter like this:

person.errors.each do |error|
  attribute = error.attribute
  message = error.message
end

You are passing a block expecting two parameters,
so the old hash behavior is simulated. As this is deprecated,
this will result in an ArgumentError in Rails 6.2.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Enumerating ActiveModel::Errors as a hash has been deprecated.
In Rails 6.1, `errors` is an array of Error objects,
therefore it should be accessed by a block with a single block
parameter like this:

person.errors.each do |error|
  attribute = error.attribute
  message = error.message
end

You are passing a block expecting two parameters,
so the old hash behavior is simulated. As this is deprecated,
this will result in an ArgumentError in Rails 6.2.
 (called from block (2 levels) in create at /myapp/app/controllers/transactions_controller.rb:29)

DEPRECATION WARNING: Enumerating ActiveModel::Errors as a hash has been deprecated.
In Rails 6.1, `errors` is an array of Error objects,
therefore it should be accessed by a block with a single block
parameter like this:

person.errors.each do |error|
  attribute = error.attribute
  message = error.message
end

You are passing a block expecting two parameters,
so the old hash behavior is simulated. As this is deprecated,
this will result in an ArgumentError in Rails 6.2.
 (called from block (2 levels) in create at /myapp/app/controllers/transactions_controller.rb:29)

DEPRECATION WARNING: Enumerating ActiveModel::Errors as a hash has been deprecated.
In Rails 6.1, `errors` is an array of Error objects,
therefore it should be accessed by a block with a single block
parameter like this:

person.errors.each do |error|
  attribute = error.attribute
  message = error.message
end

You are passing a block expecting two parameters,
so the old hash behavior is simulated. As this is deprecated,
this will result in an ArgumentError in Rails 6.2.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Enumerating ActiveModel::Errors as a hash has been deprecated.
In Rails 6.1, `errors` is an array of Error objects,
therefore it should be accessed by a block with a single block
parameter like this:

person.errors.each do |error|
  attribute = error.attribute
  message = error.message
end

You are passing a block expecting two parameters,
so the old hash behavior is simulated. As this is deprecated,
this will result in an ArgumentError in Rails 6.2.
 (called from block (2 levels) in create at /myapp/app/controllers/transactions_controller.rb:29)

DEPRECATION WARNING: Enumerating ActiveModel::Errors as a hash has been deprecated.
In Rails 6.1, `errors` is an array of Error objects,
therefore it should be accessed by a block with a single block
parameter like this:

person.errors.each do |error|
  attribute = error.attribute
  message = error.message
end

You are passing a block expecting two parameters,
so the old hash behavior is simulated. As this is deprecated,
this will result in an ArgumentError in Rails 6.2.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Enumerating ActiveModel::Errors as a hash has been deprecated.
In Rails 6.1, `errors` is an array of Error objects,
therefore it should be accessed by a block with a single block
parameter like this:

person.errors.each do |error|
  attribute = error.attribute
  message = error.message
end

You are passing a block expecting two parameters,
so the old hash behavior is simulated. As this is deprecated,
this will result in an ArgumentError in Rails 6.2.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Enumerating ActiveModel::Errors as a hash has been deprecated.
In Rails 6.1, `errors` is an array of Error objects,
therefore it should be accessed by a block with a single block
parameter like this:

person.errors.each do |error|
  attribute = error.attribute
  message = error.message
end

You are passing a block expecting two parameters,
so the old hash behavior is simulated. As this is deprecated,
this will result in an ArgumentError in Rails 6.2.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Enumerating ActiveModel::Errors as a hash has been deprecated.
In Rails 6.1, `errors` is an array of Error objects,
therefore it should be accessed by a block with a single block
parameter like this:

person.errors.each do |error|
  attribute = error.attribute
  message = error.message
end

You are passing a block expecting two parameters,
so the old hash behavior is simulated. As this is deprecated,
this will result in an ArgumentError in Rails 6.2.

DEPRECATION WARNING: Enumerating ActiveModel::Errors as a hash has been deprecated.
In Rails 6.1, `errors` is an array of Error objects,
therefore it should be accessed by a block with a single block
parameter like this:

person.errors.each do |error|
  attribute = error.attribute
  message = error.message
end

You are passing a block expecting two parameters,
so the old hash behavior is simulated. As this is deprecated,
this will result in an ArgumentError in Rails 6.2.
